Correctly determining the source of events will add information to the overall reconstruction of the logable event. By determining the source of the event correctly, analysis of the enterprise can be undertaken to determine if events tied to the source occurred in other areas within the enterprise.\n" +

When looking at the information forensically, this information is not helpful in the investigation of events. The web server must record with each event the client source of the event.",
