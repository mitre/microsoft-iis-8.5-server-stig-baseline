  title "An IIS 8.5 web server behind a load balancer or proxy server, must
  produce log records containing the source client IP and destination
  information."
  desc "Web server logging capability is critical for accurate forensic
  analysis. Without sufficient and accurate information, a correct replay of the
  events cannot be determined.

      Ascertaining the correct source, e.g. source IP, of the events is important
  during forensic analysis. Correctly determining the source of events will add
  information to the overall reconstruction of the logable event. By determining
  the source of the event correctly, analysis of the enterprise can be undertaken
  to determine if events tied to the source occurred in other areas within the
  enterprise.

      A web server behind a load balancer or proxy server, when not configured
  correctly, will record the load balancer or proxy server as the source of every
  logable event. When looking at the information forensically, this information
  is not helpful in the investigation of events. The web server must record with
  each event the client source of the event.

  If the IIS 8.5 web server is receiving inbound web traffic through a proxy, the

  passed through by the proxy server.

  Follow this procedure for web server and each website:

  Open the IIS 8.5 Manager.

  Click the IIS 8.5 web server name.

  Click the \"Logging\" icon.

  Click on \"View log files\" under the \"Actions\" pane.

  When the log file is displayed, review source IP information in log entries and
  verify the entries do not reflect the IP address of the proxy server.

  If the log entries in the log file(s) reflect the IP address of the proxy
  server as the source, this is a finding."
