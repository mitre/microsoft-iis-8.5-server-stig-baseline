  title "The IIS 8.5 web server must have Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
  (MIME) that invoke OS shell programs disabled."
  desc  "Controlling what a user of a hosted application can access is part of
  the security posture of the web server. Any time a user can access more
  functionality than is needed for the operation of the hosted application poses
  a security issue. A user with too much access can view information that is not
  needed for the user's job role, or the user could use the function in an
  unintentional manner.

      A MIME tells the web server what type of program, various file types, and
  extensions are and what external utilities or programs are needed to execute
  the file type.

      A shell is a program that serves as the basic interface between the user
  and the operating system, so hosted application users must not have access to
  these programs. Shell programs may execute shell escapes and can then perform
  unauthorized activities that could damage the security posture of the web
  server.
